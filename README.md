# Absolute Pointer - OpenTabletDriver Plugin

## 🌟 What is Absolute Pointer?
**Absolute Pointer** is a powerful plugin for **OpenTabletDriver** that gives you **total control over your pointer's behavior** without modifying the **active area** of your tablet.

Unlike traditional sensitivity settings that force you to reduce the active area to increase speed, **AbsolutePointer lets you fine-tune your movement responsiveness while keeping your full workspace intact.**

## 🔥 Why Use Absolute Pointer?

### **✅ Maintain Full Active Area with Precision**
**Without this plugin:** Increasing the pointer speed usually **reduces the tablet's active area**, limiting movement precision.

**With AbsolutePointer:** You can **increase or decrease pointer speed** while keeping the full active area, ensuring both comfort and accuracy.
