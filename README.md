# Pointer Sensitivity - OpenTabletDriver Plugin

## 🌟 What is Pointer Sensitivity?
**Pointer Sensitivity** is a plugin for **OpenTabletDriver** that allows you to adjust the **pointer sensitivity** without modifying the **active area** of your tablet.

Unlike traditional sensitivity settings that require reducing the active area to increase speed, **Pointer Sensitivity lets you fine-tune your movement responsiveness while keeping your full workspace intact.**

---

## 🔥 Why Use Pointer Sensitivity?

### **✅ Preserve Your Full Active Area**
**Without this plugin:** Adjusting the sensitivity usually means **reducing the tablet's active area**, which limits movement precision.

**With Pointer Sensitivity:** You can **increase or decrease the pointer speed while keeping the full active area**, maintaining precision and comfort.

---

### **🎯 Improved Precision & Control**
Pointer Sensitivity is ideal for:
- 🎨 **Artists & Designers** – Maintain precision at slow speeds while allowing fluid motion for larger movements.
- 🎮 **Gamers** – Get faster responsiveness without losing accuracy or adjusting to a smaller active zone.
- 💼 **Everyday Use** – Adapt sensitivity for different tasks like navigation, design, and gaming.

### **🚀 No More Manual Adjustments**
Instead of constantly changing your tablet’s active area in OpenTabletDriver, **simply adjust your sensitivity on demand** with Pointer Sensitivity.

📌 **Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Increased responsiveness without sacrificing precision.**
- ✅ **Full control over speed without resizing your workspace.**
- ✅ **Ideal for absolute mode (no catch-up delay).**
